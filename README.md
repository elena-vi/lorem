# Introduction to Git

> *Git good at Git* - Made Tech, 2020

## What is Git

A way of:

- tracking changes to files
- easily collaborating with others
- storing code in a distributed way i.e. a copy of the code is stored on a
  server and on the local machine of each developer (unlike a centralised way
  where code is stored in a single place)

## Why do we use Git

- Single source of truth
- History of changes to file
- Easy collaboration using branching and merging

## Practical

### Aim

To get Tech Ops comfortable with making changes and resolving merge conflicts
using Git through a pull request flow.

### Level 1 - Making changes

1. Clone this repository
2. Check out into a new branch
3. Add one thing you like to the ["tings I like"](/tings-i-like.md) list
4. Commit and push your changes to :octocat:
5. Open and request a review from someone

### Level 2 - Resolving conflicts

> You and El have been collaborating on a branch called `tings_you_n_el_likes`.

1. Pull down the existing branch called `tings_you_n_el_likes`
2. Add another thing you like to the ["ting I like"](/tings-i-like.md) list
3. Commit and push your changes to :octocat:
4. Open a new pull request and resolve the merge conflicts
