# Introduction to Git

> *Git good at Git* - Made Tech, 2020

## What is Git

A way of:

- tracking changes to files
- easily collaborating with others
- storing code in a distributed way i.e. a copy of the code is stored on a
  server and on the local machine of each developer (unlike a centralised way
  where code is stored in a single place)

## Why do we use Git

- Single source of truth
- History of changes to file
- Easy collaboration using branching and merging

## Practical

### Level 1

- Clone this repository
- Check out into a new branch
- Add one thing you like to the ["ting I like"](/tings-i-like.md) list
- Commit and push your changes to :octocat:
- Open and merge a new pull request

### Level 2
    > you and el have been collaborating on a branch called `tings_you_n_el_likes`

  - Pull down the existing branch called `tings_you_n_el_likes`
  - Add another thing you like to the ["ting I like"](/tings-i-like.md) list
  - Commit and push your changes to :octocat:
  - Open a new pull request and resolve the merge conflicts
